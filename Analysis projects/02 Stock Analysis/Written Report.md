Before factoring, the code took more than 0.50 seconds in execution. However, with proper refactoring, the execution times have decreased siginificantly to approximately 0.11 seconds for 2017 stocks and 0.27 seconds for 2018 stocks. 



## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
